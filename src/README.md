# Introduction

My name is **Ritchie Flick** and this is my personal collection of **Katas**
or collection of code snippets and commands. I have started collecting these,
as some problems and requirements are recurring and I don't want to reinvent the wheel every time or google for the same solution.

As I started working on this collection, I realized that it is a good way to
give a little bit back to the community and publish it on GitHub and as a
website using **mdBook**. This way people can benefit from it and I can get
feedback and learn from others.
